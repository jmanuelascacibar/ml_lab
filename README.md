# ML practice challenges

This repository is a collection of machine learning challenges designed to build muscle memory for common ML taks. 
The idea is to use it as a gym to strengthen your skills through repetition and practical application. Following the flashcard philosophy, each notebook presents a specific challenge wih clear requirements and hints to guide your implementation. 

# Challenge format

Each notebook follows a consistent structure:

1. Challenge description of the objective and the skills being practiced.
2. Setup section of data loading / generation
3. Requirements about what need to be accomplished
4. Pre-structured cells with placeholders
5. Complete solution.

# My idea how to use it

1. Choose a challenge
2. Read the requirements to understand what you need to implement
3. Check your solution against the provided complete solution
4. Repeat regularly and spaced in time to build muscle memory.

# Principles
This repository is built around the idea of deliberate practice, active recall, and spaced repetition.
